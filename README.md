# Don-Quixote-Language-Analysis

For my final project in my _AP Spanish Language and Culture_ class I researched the novel _Don Quixote_.

This is a Python and matplotlib project I created to generate interesting data I could include in my presentation. I used this copy of [_Don Quixote_](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2000/2000-h/2000-h.htm) on the Project Gutenberg website.
