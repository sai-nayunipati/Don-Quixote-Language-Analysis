# Don-Quixote-Language-Analysis

For my final project in my _AP Spanish Language and Culture_ class I researched how elements of Old Castilian appear in _Don Quixote_. This [web page](https://users.pfw.edu/jehle/courses/s450/vocabcer.htm) provides good examples of what that includes.

This is a Python and matplotlib project I created to generate interesting data I could include in my presentation.
